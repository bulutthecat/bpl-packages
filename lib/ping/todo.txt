Functions that need to be added:

-c count: Stop after sending (and receiving) count ECHO_RESPONSE packets.
-i interval: Wait interval seconds between sending each packet. The default is to wait for one second between each packet.
-I interface: Specify a network interface to use for sending packets.
-t ttl: Set the IP Time to Live.
-s packetsize: Specify the number of data bytes to be sent. The default is 56, which translates to 64 ICMP data bytes when combined with the 8 bytes of ICMP header data.
-W timeout: Time to wait for a response, in seconds.
-q: Quiet output. Only the summary lines at startup time and when finished will be printed.
-a: Audible ping. Beep when a packet is received.
-V: Print version and exit.
-D: Print timestamp (unix time + microseconds as in gettimeofday) before each line.
-n: Numeric output only. No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic names for host addresses.
-p pattern: You may specify up to 16 pattern bytes to fill out the packet you send. This is useful for diagnosing data-dependent problems in a network.

additional functions that could be implemented:

Detailed Statistics Logging:

    Extended Logging:
        --log-file <file>: Specify a file to log detailed information about each ping attempt.
        --log-format <format>: Specify the format of the log file, e.g., text, CSV.
    Graphical Output:
        --graph-output <file>: Generate a graphical representation of the ping results and save it to the specified file.

Advanced Error Handling:

    Error Classification:
        --verbose-errors: Display categorized and detailed error messages.
    Retry Logic:
        --retry <count>: Number of retry attempts for failed pings.
        --retry-interval <interval>: Interval between retry attempts.

Enhanced Security and Privacy Features:

    Encrypted Pings:
        --encrypt <key>: Use the specified key to encrypt the payload of ICMP packets.
    Anonymized Pings:
        --anonymize: Anonymize source and destination IP addresses in logs and outputs.

Customizable Output Formats:

    JSON/XML Output:
        --output-format <json|xml>: Format the output as JSON or XML.
    Custom Templates:
        --output-template <template>: Use a custom template for the output.

Integration with Other Network Tools:

    Traceroute Integration:
        --auto-traceroute: Perform a traceroute if the ping fails.
    DNS Diagnostics:
        --dns-lookup: Perform DNS resolution checks and display DNS lookup times.

Enhanced Timing and Scheduling:

    Scheduled Pings:
        --schedule <cron_expression>: Schedule pings to run at specified times.
    Adaptive Interval:
        --adaptive-interval: Automatically adjust the ping interval based on network conditions.

Custom Packet Payloads:

    Payload Content:
        --payload <data>: Specify custom content for the ping packet payload.
    Variable Payload Size:
        --vary-payload: Vary the packet size during the ping session to test different MTU sizes.

Multi-Host and Multi-Interface Support:

    Batch Ping:
        --batch <file>: Specify a file containing a list of hosts to ping.
    Multi-Interface Ping:
        --interfaces <interface1,interface2,...>: Send pings from multiple network interfaces concurrently.

Geolocation Information:

    Geolocation Lookup:
        --geolocation: Display geolocation information for the target IP address.

Alerting and Notifications:

    Threshold-Based Alerts:
        --alert-threshold <latency|packetloss>:<value>: Set thresholds for latency or packet loss and trigger alerts.
    Real-Time Notifications:
        --notify <method>: Specify the method of notification (e.g., email, SMS) for significant events.
